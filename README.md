# Machine-Learning-And-Artificial-Intelligence
<marquee>Machine learning repository</marquee>

Topics include:<br/>
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).<br/>
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). <br/>
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).<br/> 

These works are from the assignments of Andrew Ng's class. I completed them in gnu ocatave.
