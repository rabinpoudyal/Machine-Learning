# Machine-Learning-And-Artificial-Intelligence
Machine learning and AI code repository

What is it all about?
Machine learning is the future of computer science.
I have a wide range of notes and codes in this repository in 
Machine learning,
Datamining,
And Statistical pattern recognition

Topics include:
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 

Learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
