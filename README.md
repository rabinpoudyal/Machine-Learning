What is it all about?<br/>
Machine learning is the future of computer science.
I have a wide range of notes and codes in this repository in<br/> 
Machine learning,<br/>
Datamining,<br/>
And Statistical pattern recognition<br/>

Topics include:<br/>
(i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).<br/>
(ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). <br/>
(iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).<br/> 

Learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
