In univariate linear regression we have only one variable but in multivariate regression,
Contains multiple variables
for example our housing example has more features like no of bedrooms, distance from highway, age(in years) etc.

for example x1,x2,x3...........xn => denotes the variables
where n is number of features

Previously in our hypothesis:

h-theta(x) = theta-not + theat-one(x)

But in multivariate regression 

h-theta(x) = theta-not + theta-one-x-one + theta-two-x-two + ....... + theta-n-x-n

for convience of notation say x-not = 1
( x-not for i th feature vector = 1 )
so,
	x = [
		 x0
		 x1
		 x2
		 ....
		 xn
		 ]
		 belongs to n+1 feature vector

	and the parameter vector are

	theta = [
			 theta-0
			 theta-1
			 theta-2
			   ....
			 theta-n
			 ]

So now in our multivariate equation,

	h-not(x) = theta-0-x0 + theta-1-x1 + ..... + theta-n-xn
			 = theta-transpose-X
			 = theta-T-x
