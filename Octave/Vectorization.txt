
	we know, h-theta(x) = Sigma(theta-j * x-j ) from j=0 to n

	but theta'x gives same result which is the vectorized implementation

	so
	the unvectorized implementation is 

	prediction = 0.0;
	for j = 1:n+1
		prediction = prediction + theta(j) * x(j)
	end;

	Vectorized computation:

	prediction = theta' * x
