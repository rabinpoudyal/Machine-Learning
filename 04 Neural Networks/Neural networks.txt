Why do we need neural networks?

Say we have a complex supervised learning classification problem.
We can use logistic regression with many polynomial terms for solving this hypothesis.
But what if the number of feature is very high say n=100. Then?
It is not wise to use polynomial term to fit the hypothesis because,
		
		If we are to include all the quadratic terms for fitting our model then the size of polynomial is going to be roughly
		big-Oh of n-squared / 2

		So, for n=100
		no. of polynomial terms = 100^2/2 = approx(50000) polynomial terms.
		like x1^2, x1*x2, x1*x3 ............... x1*x100
		x2*x1, x2^2, .......................... x2*x100
		...............................................
		x100*x1 .................................x100^2

		And only crazy people will do this

		So what if we decide to fit the quadratic function in the model?
		Another trouble because this would give approx big-Oh of n^3/3 polynomials.
		e.g. (x12x2, x1x2x3, x1x4x23 etc)
		There are even more features grows O(n^s3)
		About 170 000 features for n = 100
		So the main idea is we can't use logistic regression to fit the hypothesis better.

		A way around where another solution is to use only the subset of the polynomial.
		However, if you don't have enough features, often a model won't let you fit a complex dataset.

The logistic regression works well when you have 1-2 features(that is when you can simply list all the polynomial terms for example for two features you can list 4 polynomial terms).
But if you have 100 features it is not practical.

EXAMPLE WHERE N IS LARGE => COMPUTER VISION

	The way human sees the image but computers see the matrix of pixels intensity values.
	It looks at the matrix and explains what these numbers represent.

	Say we want to build a car detector:
		Then we need to build a training set of
			Not cars and
			Cars
		Then test against cars

		How can we do this?
			Plot two pixels (ie pixels locations?)
			Plot car vs non-car on the graph

		We need a non linear hypothesis to seperate the class.
	
	Consider a image of 50px by 50px = 2500px so n=2500
	If RGB then 7500px
	If 100*100 RBG then --> 50000000 features 

	And this is too big 
		So simple logistic regression is not going to work for problems like this complex systems
		Neural Networks are far more better for complex hypothesis even when the feature space is huge.



NEURAL NETWORKS:

	Originally motivated by looking at machines whuch replicate the brain's functionality.

	Origins:
		To build learning techniques
		NNs are computationally expensive so only now neural networks become more computationally feasible.


MODEL REPRESENTATION 1

	How can we represent NNs?
		Simulate the network of biological neurons

	Artificial neural network - representation of neuron

	In artificial neural network, a neurone is a logistic unit 
		Feed input via input wires
		Logistic unit does computaion
		Sends optput down output wires

		say
			x = [x0
				 x1
				 x2
				 x3]

			θ = [θ0
				 θ1
				 θ2
				 θ3]

			hθ(x) = 1 / (1 + e^θ'x)

		This is very simple model of neuron's computation. It is often good to include x0 as input - biased unit
			This is equal to 1

		This is an artificial neurone with sigmoid(logistic) activation function
		θ vector is also called as weights of a model
