In univariate linear regression we have only one variable or feature but in multivariate regression,
 we have multiple variables or features.
 For example in univariate linear regression we have:
 	X = house size, used to predict
 	y = house price

 	But,

 In multivariate linear regression we can have
 	X1 = size,
 	X2 = no of bedrooms,
 	X3 = age of house
 	X4 = number of floors etc.
 	and
 	y = Output variable of house price

NOTATION CONVENTIONS USED:
	n => number of features or variables;
	m => number of examples(number of rows in table)
	x<sup>i</sup> => vector of input for example(for i<sup>th</sup> input example)
	


for example x1,x2,x3...........xn => denotes the variables
where n is number of features

Previously in our hypothesis:

h-theta(x) = theta-not + theat-one(x)

But in multivariate regression 

h-theta(x) = theta-not + theta-one-x-one + theta-two-x-two + ....... + theta-n-x-n

for convience of notation say x-not = 1
( x-not for i th feature vector = 1 )
so,
	x = [
		 x0
		 x1
		 x2
		 ....
		 xn
		 ]
		 belongs to n+1 feature vector

	and the parameter vector are

	theta = [
			 theta-0
			 theta-1
			 theta-2
			   ....
			 theta-n
			 ]

So now in our multivariate equation,

	h-not(x) = theta-0-x0 + theta-1-x1 + ..... + theta-n-xn
			 = theta-transpose-X
			 = theta-T-x
